				World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
			</h1>
			<p>
				With the newest installment of the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, new adventures await with the addition
				of 2 new continents with 3 zones in each, journey to level 120, Island scenarios, and the addition of allied
				races. With what is supposedly a large upgrade from the current expansion, Legion, Battle for Azeroth may live
				up to the hype or fall flat depending on how Alpha testing goes.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Alpha: First Impressions
			</h2>
			<p>
				After looking through many sources that currently have Alpha since I do not (#NoAlphaClub), I have noticed that
				the current iteration of the game doesn't bring many features to be tested. With only 2 zones playable, one for
				each faction, and about half the abilities that are expected to ship with the game, it is hard to tell at this
				point whether or not class development is solid or whether or not 3 zones per faction is enough to sate the 
				thirst for new content. So far the dungeons look fantastic and are pretty blatantly designed with Mythic+ in mind,
				which is good. With only a few additions to play test, the overall impression of the game this early is yet to be
				determined.
